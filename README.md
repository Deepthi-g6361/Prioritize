# Prioritize
Task manager app

What Did I Build?
Prioritize is a React-based task management application that will:

1. Add, delete, and tasks as complete: A dynamic app task list that updates as you interact with it.
2. Persistant storage with localStorage: Your tasks will be saved even if you refresh the page
3. Responsive design: The app will adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience on everyone.
4. Live deployment: By the end, you'll deploy the app to platforms like GitHub Pages or Netlify, making it accessible to everyone.
