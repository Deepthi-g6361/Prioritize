# Prioritize
A React-based task management application to help you organize and track your tasks efficiently.

## What Did I Build?
Prioritize allows users to:

1. **Add, delete, and mark tasks as complete** – Dynamic task list that updates in real-time.
2. **Persistent storage with localStorage** – Tasks are saved even after refreshing the page.
3. **Responsive design** – Works smoothly on different screen sizes.
4. **View task history** – See completed tasks, with options to restore or delete them.
5. **Progress tracking** – Visual tracker showing the percentage of tasks completed.

## Core Features
1. **Task Input Form**
   - Add tasks using an input field and submit button.
   - Validates input to prevent empty or duplicate tasks.
2. **Task List**
   - Displays tasks dynamically with completion status.
   - Mark tasks as complete or delete them.
3. **Persistent Data**
   - Saves tasks in `localStorage` so they persist after refreshing.
4. **Progress Tracker**
   - Shows visual progress dynamically as tasks are updated.
5. **Task History**
   - View and manage completed tasks.
